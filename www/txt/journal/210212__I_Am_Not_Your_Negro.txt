<p>Happy Friday and Happy Black History Month.</p>

<p>I think it's time for a tone shift. I'm feeling angry for this entry.
But I think that's a good thing. One
of my favorite quotes, like the title of this entry, is from James Baldwin:
"To be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of
rage."</p>

<p>I've been trying to reaffirm to myself this year that feelings are
neither "right" nor "wrong"; they just are, like colors of the rainbow, and anger is one
of them. Nothing to be ashamed or judgmental about, like "I'm an
angry person", it just is, an ephemeral feeling. It's
uncontrolled anger--rage--that is problematic, and it's problematic
precisely for the lack of control. An individual cannot
choose feelings, but they can choose how they respond to feelings. In
the case of two recent incidents, think I've been making better choices lately.</p>

<p>1) I checked into a popular podcast for the first time in forever out
of boredom, and was quickly reminded of why I had stepped away from it
when I heard a terribly race-ignorant take. The middle-aged white male
podcast guest talked about his immigrant background and terrible
Soviet Union history like a child's parents being killed for "treason"
and the kid being orphanzed/ostracized as a "traitor child", and how
"Americans don't know how bad things can get and what that's like".</p>

<p>Then I reflected on how it's black history month and reflected on everything black people have been through in America like slavery and Jim Crow and lynchings and thought...... yep, he's 10000% right. ðŸ™ƒ</p>

<p>Because you know, black Americans aren't Americans I guess. Nope,
"Americans don't know what that's like". The Autobiography of Malcolm
X totally doesn't exist.</p>

<p>I immediately turned it off and started working on this site again.</p>

<p>2) I was very angry earlier this week when my next door neighbor informed
me that he had surveillance of somebody stealing a package from his
front porch, and the thief was spotted talking to someone I just
rented to. As someone who has had bad experiences renting to people
in the past--from being lied to in my face about floodings and having my own family members
threatened with weapons, and also as a person who succumbs to rage
sometimes--I
first lost it. My mind immediately jumped to the worst conclusions,
thinking
that the kind and respectful image this person had portrayed to gain
the rental was a deception, and this was their "mask off" moment...that
I was yet again "naive" and "stupid" and too-trusting and let an
immoral person rent my property.</p>

<p>Then I checked myself. I actively sought to remove emotion and not
assume anything, no matter what my own angry/scarred ego was
telling me. I sought ego-death, because my ego was screaming at
me "Look Sean, you were too trusting again, it's happening all over again, you're being
betrayed/lied to/hurt like all those other people did before,
GET ANGRY AND ATTACK!"</p>

<p>But I said "No".</p>

<p>Because you can never retract a hurtful, frivolous accusation or
attack, no matter how much your ego convinces you that you are
"correct".</p>

<p>So I assumed nothing, and approached the person with dispassionate
politeness like "Help me
understand this footage, please. What do you see?"</p>

<p>Turns out, the thief the person was with was a random mover that was
only here for that one day, that the rentee has no actual relationship with. They were just as confused as my
neighbor, and they also felt betrayed that a random mover would do
such a thing and compromise their own image, and said they planned to
confront the person themselves.</p>

<p>So see, instead of succumbing to my ego and going into self-righteous
accusing/attack mode, I approached with kindness and understanding.
And the person themselves said they really appreciated that.</p>

<p>As insignificant as that might seem, I consider that a big
psychological victory for
me. I felt the emotion of anger, I felt my ego run wild, but after
that I made a
<i>choice</i>. If I had acted impulsively, all pure ego and <i>"Look what you did to me!"</i>, I could've destroyed a
relationship. You can always calm yourself down from an initial raw
reaction to process your feelings, but you can never retract terrible
words/accusations.</p>

<p>I used to feel upset that other people who I previously held in high regard
wouldn't/couldn't afford me that same
courtesy when I needed it, and instead accused/attacked me for
perceived slights I had no idea about, triggering
confusion/hurt/defensiveness/anger within me, only to further attack me by holding my attempt to calmly exit the situation against me.</p>

<p>Now, I don't care anymore. I am not perfect, but I know what I am
worth and what I do and do not deserve, and I am not anybody's
negro. All the relationships I have are not unconditional, like that
old
corny Pokemon "Together Forever" song, they're at-will, and if you
<i>chronically</i> break the contract of basic
respect and responsibility for actions with me, then I am done. We are all adults and human beings suffering with our daily
personal battles and psychoses and egos/ids, trying to make the best of the worst
historical time right now. The last thing anybody needs is reckless
emotional attacks because somebody is too stuck in their own head of
self-hurt/victimization that they cannot see that they, themselves,
are actually the ones hurting others, and probably destroying the relationship
in the process.</p>

<p>Love yourself and love each other, but do not love anybody/anything
over your beautiful black self. You are not anybody's negro. If
somebody slips up and thinks that you are, firmly remind them that
you're not. And it's okay to get a little angry if you do, so long as
you keep control.  :)</p>
