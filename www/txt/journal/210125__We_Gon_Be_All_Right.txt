<p>Happy New Year to all reading this. This marks my first entry for the
year, and my third ever. With the recent code update I just made, it
will definitely be the first of many more to come.</p>

<p>This was probably the most challenging New Year ever. Probably because
it's following the most challenging year ever, 2020, the year of a
100-year global pandemic, 50-year civil unrest, and near electoral disaster. Of course, problems
were never going to disappear from a simple change of year--this much
I knew. But things eerily escalated right in the very first week, all
within and without. Week 1 of 2021 didn't just seem to be a
continuation of 2020, week 1 felt like 2020 itself.</p>

<p>The ultimate upside is that, just like 2020, I endured much pain, but
came out stronger and more understanding in the end.</p>

<p>Like 2020, I took stock of many things around me, and inside of me.
Despite all the work and progress done in 2020, I realized I stlll had
more to do. Certain old patterns no longer served me, and despite how
much stronger I thought I was, I was still too admittedly co-dependent and
appeasing to admit it--and accordingly, I still wasn't respecting myself enough.</p>

<p>I've been hurt before, even physically, in ways that exacerbate my own
problems, or even made me feel like I deserved what happened to me.</p>

<p>I've also emotionally hurt others, too, even if unintentionally.</p>

<p>There is so much pain in the world now than in any other time in my
life, and it's so sad. I miss so many people/places/things, and I have so many
regrets. There are several people I wish things could've been
different with, but can now no longer talk to.</p>

<p>I can't change the past, but I thank them for all the growth they have
helped me achieve, and I hope we can all find the peace and happiness we deserve in
this crazy world.</p>

<p>Last year was about not giving up on myself; the beginning of this
year seems to be about giving up bad or non-serving things. Among
other things, I haven't drank since the new year, either (yup, that's
a long time for me). And I'm continuing to update this site with my
own feelings/writings, and about to start a project with a friend. I'm
actively learning languages again every day, hopeful to travel for our
collective non-COVID future.  Despite the pain of week 1, like 2020 I survived, and here I am. I am
all right.</p>

<p>And I know you will be, too.</p>
