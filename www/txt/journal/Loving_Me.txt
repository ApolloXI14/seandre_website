<h1>Lovin' Me</h1>

<p>Helping me is helping we.</p>
<p>This is what I've learned lately.</p>

<p>Because what good are the things that I'm good at, if I do nothing
with them?</p>

<p>I can be obsessive over things sometimes. Lately, I've been obsessed
with progress. Nothing like being stuck at home for eight months to fill
you with existential dread and a desperation to get your long deferred
desires into motion, eh?</p>

<p>One of my favorite music artists ever, Kid Cudi, just released a new
album "Man on the Moon III: The Chosen One". It wasn't the masterpiece
I hold MoTM1-2 up as, but I did like it. As a music lover and
sensitive soul, I always related deeply to his psychedelic
hip-hop/rock fusion from the late 2000's, and I believe we've both
been through a lot in this past decade of our (obviously very
different) lives.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tracks on the new album is called "Lovin' Me". I
love the ethereal synth in the background, and how uplifting and
positive the lyrics are.</p>

<p><i>My past don't matter babe</i></p>
<p><i>I'm much stronger</i></p>
<p><i>In fact much farther</i></p>

<p>These lyrics hit me as a perfectionist/self-critic who, in my worst
moments, loves to replay terrible memories/mistakes in my head and
thinks that forbids me from deserving anything good in the present.
That is a lie I refuse to believe anymore.</p>

<p>So I am loving me, by helping me...and we.</p>

<p>Happy Friday, everyone.</p>
