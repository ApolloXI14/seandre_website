I\'m feeling angry for this entry.\nBut I think that\'s a good thing. One\nof my favorite quotes, like the title of this entry, is from James Baldwin:\n"To be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of\nrage."</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve been trying to reaffirm to myself this year that feelings are\nneither "right" nor "wrong"; they just are, like colors of the rainbow, and anger is one\nof them. Nothing to be ashamed or judgmental about, like "I\'m an\nangry person", it just is, an ephemeral feeling. It\'s\nuncontrolled anger--rage--that is problematic, and it\'s problematic\nprecisely for the lack of control. An individual cannot\nchoose feelings, but they can choose how they respond to feelings. In\nthe case of two recent incidents, think I\'ve been making better choices lately.</p>\n\n<p>1) I checked into a popular podcast for the first time in forever out\nof boredom, and was quickly reminded of why I had stepped away from it\nwhen I heard a terribly race-ignorant take. The middle-aged white male\npodcast guest talked about his immigrant background and terrible\nSoviet Union history like a child\'s parents being killed for "treason"\nand the kid being orphanzed/ostracized as a "traitor child", and how\n"Americans don\'t know how bad things can get and what that\'s like".</p>\n\n<p>Then I reflected on how it\'s black history month and reflected on everything black people have been through in America like slavery and Jim Crow and lynchings and thought...... yep, he\'s 10000% right. \ud83d\ude43</p>\n\n<p>Because you know, black Americans aren\'t Americans I guess. Nope,\n"Americans don\'t know what that\'s like". The Autobiography of Malcolm\nX totally doesn\'t exist.</p>\n\n<p>I immediately turned it off and started working on this site again.</p>\n\n<p>2) I was very angry earlier this week when my next door neighbor informed\nme that he had surveillance of somebody stealing a package from his\nfront porch, and the thief was spotted talking to someone I just\nrented to. As someone who has had bad experiences renting to people\nin the past--from being lied to in my face about floodings and having my own family members\nthreatened with weapons, and also as a person who succumbs to rage\nsometimes--I\nfirst lost it. My mind immediately jumped to the worst conclusions,\nthinking\nthat the kind and respectful image this person had portrayed to gain\nthe rental was a deception, and this was their "mask off" moment...that\nI was yet again "naive" and "stupid" and too-trusting and let an\nimmoral person rent my property.</p>\n\n<p>Then I checked myself. I actively sought to remove emotion and not\nassume anything, no matter what my own angry/scarred ego was\ntelling me. I sought ego-death, because my ego was screaming at\nme "Look Sean, you were too trusting again, it\'s happening all over again, you\'re being\nbetrayed/lied to/hurt like all those other people did before,\n<i>get angry and attack!</i>"</p>\n\n<p>But I said "No".</p>\n\n<p>Because you can never retract a hurtful, frivolous accusation or\nattack, no matter how much your ego convinces you that you are\n"correct".</p>\n\n<p>So I assumed nothing, and approached the person with dispassionate\npoliteness like "Help me\nunderstand this footage, please. What do you see?"</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, the thief the person was with was a random mover that was\nonly here for that one day, that the rentee has no actual relationship with. They were just as confused as my\nneighbor, and they also felt betrayed that a random mover would do\nsuch a thing and compromise their own image, and said they planned to\nconfront the person themselves.</p>\n\n<p>So see, instead of succumbing to my ego and going into self-righteous\naccusing/attack mode, I approached with kindness and understanding.\nAnd the person themselves said they really appreciated that.</p>\n\n<p>As insignificant as that might seem, I consider that a big\npsychological victory for\nme. I felt the emotion of anger, I felt my ego run wild, but after\nthat I made a\n<i>choice</i>. If I had acted impulsively, all pure ego and <i>"Look what you did to me!"</i>, I could\'ve destroyed a\nrelationship. You can always calm yourself down from an initial raw\nreaction to process your feelings, but you can never retract terrible\nwords/accusations.</p>\n\n<p>I used to feel upset that other people who I previously held in high regard\nwouldn\'t/couldn\'t afford me that same\ncourtesy when I needed it, and instead accused/attacked me for\nperceived slights I had no idea about, triggering\nconfusion/hurt/defensiveness/anger within me, only to further attack me by holding my attempt to calmly exit the situation against me.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don\'t care anymore. I am not perfect, but I know what I am\nworth and what I do and do not deserve, and I am not anybody\'s\nnegro. All the relationships I have are not unconditional, like that\nold\ncorny Pokemon "Together Forever" song, they\'re at-will, and if you\n<i>chronically</i> break the contract of basic\nrespect and responsibility for actions with me, then I am done. We are all adults and human beings suffering with our daily\npersonal battles and psychoses and egos/ids, trying to make the best of the worst\nhistorical time right now. The last thing anybody needs is reckless\nemotional attacks because somebody is too stuck in their own head of\nself-hurt/victimization that they cannot see that they, themselves,\nare actually the ones hurting others, and probably destroying relationships\nin the process.</p>\n\n<p>Love yourself and love each other, but do not love anybody/anything\nover your beautiful black self. You are not anybody\'s negro. If\nsomebody slips up and thinks that you are, firmly remind them that\nyou\'re not. And it\'s okay to get a little angry if you do, so long as\nyou keep control.  :)</p>\n'},Fj4A:function(e,t,n){var a={"./201205__My_First_Entry.txt":"T1Je","./201218__Lovin_Me.txt":"8/j5","./210125__We_Gon_Be_All_Right.txt":"MJNO","./210212__I_Am_Not_Your_Negro.txt":"8pa8","./210213__Phrases_That_Annoy_Me.txt":"N1oB","./210221__Pizza_and_Perspective.txt":"xwZc"};function o(e){var t=i(e);return n(t)}function i(e){if(!n.o(a,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}return a[e]}o.keys=function(){return Object.keys(a)},o.resolve=i,e.exports=o,o.id="Fj4A"},MJNO:function(e,t,n){"use strict";e.exports="<h1>We Gon Be All Right</h1>\n<h4>01/25/21 9:30AM</h4>\n\n<p>Happy New Year to all reading this. This marks my first entry for the\nyear, and my third ever. With the recent code update I just made, it\nwill definitely be the first of many more to come.</p>\n\n<p>This was probably the most challenging New Year ever. Probably because\nit's following the most challenging year ever, 2020, the year of a\n100-year global pandemic, 50-year civil unrest, and near electoral disaster. Of course, problems\nwere never going to disappear from a simple change of year--this much\nI knew. But things eerily escalated right in the very first week, all\nwithin and without. Week 1 of 2021 didn't just seem to be a\ncontinuation of 2020, week 1 felt like 2020 itself.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate upside is that, just like 2020, I endured much pain, but\ncame out stronger and more understanding in the end.</p>\n\n<p>Like 2020, I took stock of many things around me, and inside of me.\nDespite all the work and progress done in 2020, I realized I stlll had\nmore to do. Certain old patterns no longer served me, and despite how\nmuch stronger I thought I was, I was still too admittedly co-dependent and\nappeasing to admit it--and accordingly, I still wasn't respecting myself enough.</p>\n\n<p>I've been hurt before, even physically, in ways that exacerbate my own\nproblems, or even made me feel like I deserved what happened to me.</p>\n\n<p>I've also emotionally hurt others, too, even if unintentionally.</p>\n\n<p>There is so much pain in the world now than in any other time in my\nlife, and it's so sad. I miss so many people/places/things, and I have so many\nregrets. There are several people I wish things could've been\ndifferent with, but can now no longer talk to.</p>\n\n<p>I can't change the past, but I thank them for all the growth they have\nhelped me achieve, and I hope we can all find the peace and happiness we deserve in\nthis crazy world.</p>\n\n<p>Last year was about not giving up on myself; the beginning of this\nyear seems to be about giving up bad or non-serving things. Among\nother things, I haven't drank since the new year, either (yup, that's\na long time for me). And I'm continuing to update this site with my\nown feelings/writings, and about to start a project with a friend. I'm\nactively learning languages again every day, hopeful to travel for our\ncollective non-COVID future.  Despite the pain of week 1, like 2020 I survived, and here I am.

The right series of words strung together can be as gorgeous to me as all the art in the Louvre. But language is always changing, and it doesn\'t always change to my liking; sometimes I find it redundant or nonsensical, or just poor in grammar. And I have an old lit degree and a keyboard, and you\'re here for some reason, so I demand you listen to me. Here are some phrases I dislike.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><cite>"Make it make sense"</cite> - Saying "make" twice makes no sense. Just say... "Make sense". (Make sense?)</li>\n<li><cite>"Yes and no"</cite> - This is a meaningless non-statement, the verbal equivalent of dividing by zero, a paradox. If a waiter asked me if I wanted water, and I said "Yes and no", I\'d be looked at very funny. I\'ve heard this phrase be defended as an alternate way to to say "It\'s complicated", and my reply is... <i>just say that!</i> "Yes and no" or its alternate "It is and it isn\'t" is just hoity-toity nothingness. Just say what you mean.</li>\n<li><cite>"First and last"</cite> - "Last" is an antonym of "first", because "last" means the end of a series or set, so something cannot simultaneously be the first  <i>and</i> last of something. You\'ll never hear a train conductor say "This is the first <i>and</i> last stop of this train!" What people really mean when they say this is "first and <i>only</i>"</li>\n<li><cite>"Could care less"</cite> - How much less?</li>\n<li><cite>"Sorry, I\'m an [insert astrological sign here]"</cite> - Not really a violation of grammar so much as a violation of common sense and decency. Blaming disproven astrological beliefs and the stars and Mars for all of your mistakes is the height of being basic to me. I get it, I used to be into astrology, too...but then I got out of my early 20s.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I felt like there were more that are escaping my mind right now, but I\'ll just conclude it right here.

I've had to deal with anger issues, punching holes, hurting myself unnecessarily, and fixing everything.
