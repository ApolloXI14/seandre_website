Lately, I've been obsessed\\nwith progress. Nothing like being stuck at home for eight months to fill\\nyou with existential dread and a desperation to get your long deferred\\ndesires into motion, eh?</p>\\n\\n<p>One of my favorite music artists ever, Kid Cudi, just released a new\\nalbum \\\"Man on the Moon III: The Chosen One\\\". It wasn't the masterpiece\\nI hold MoTM1-2 up as, but I did like it. As a music lover and\\nsensitive soul, I always related deeply to his psychedelic\\nhip-hop/rock fusion from the late 2000's, and I believe we've both\\nbeen through a lot in this past decade of our (obviously very\\ndifferent) lives.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of my favorite tracks on the new album is called \\\"Lovin' Me\\\". I\\nlove the ethereal synth in the background, and how uplifting and\\npositive the lyrics are.</p>\\n\\n<p><i>My past don't matter babe</i></p>\\n<p><i>I'm much stronger</i></p>\\n<p><i>In fact much farther</i></p>\\n\\n<p>These lyrics hit me as a perfectionist/self-critic who, in my worst\\nmoments, loves to replay terrible memories/mistakes in my head and\\nthinks that forbids me from deserving anything good in the present.\\nThat is a lie I refuse to believe anymore.</p>\\n\\n<p>So I am loving me, by helping me...and we.</p>\\n\\n<p>Happy Friday, everyone.</p>\\n\";","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
