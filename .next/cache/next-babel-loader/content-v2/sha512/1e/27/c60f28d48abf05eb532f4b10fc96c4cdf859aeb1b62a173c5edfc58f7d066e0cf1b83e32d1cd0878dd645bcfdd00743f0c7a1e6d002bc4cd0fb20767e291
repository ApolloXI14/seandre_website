I had built up an appetite after an afternoon of\\ncoding, so I decided to pre-order on the phone from them. Especially now in the era of COVID,\\nif I can pre-order food to minimize my time inside, then I'll happily\\ndo so, and I'm a regular there who always orders the same thing.</p>\\n\\n<p>So I was quite surprised and irritated when I gave my order but was\\ntold rather curtly and rudely to \\\"just order when you come\\\", because\\nmy order was insufficient, and they ended the call quickly.</p>\\n\\n<p>I decided to go there anyway, but my mood was a bit soured. Once I\\ngot there, I discovered that they were backed up with about an hour's\\nworth of uncollected pickup orders, and were still taking more. My order was thankfully among\\nthem, so I didn't have to order and wait, but I finally understood why\\nthey were so rude and snippy earlier.</p>\\n\\n<p>I felt better about people for awhile, until I passed by a person\\nidling in their car who locked their doors as I walked by.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Yeah, gun, mask, and pizza, all the essentials to commit grand theft\\nauto. That is some purse-clutching wuss behavior right there.</p>\\n\";","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
