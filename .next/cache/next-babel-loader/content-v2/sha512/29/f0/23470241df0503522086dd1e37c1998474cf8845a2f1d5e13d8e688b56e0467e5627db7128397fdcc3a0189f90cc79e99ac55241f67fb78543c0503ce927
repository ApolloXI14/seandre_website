This marks my first entry for the\\nyear, and my third ever. With the recent code update I just made, it\\nwill definitely be the first of many more to come.</p>\\n\\n<p>This was probably the most challenging New Year ever. Probably because\\nit's following the most challenging year ever, 2020, the year of a\\n100-year global pandemic, 50-year civil unrest, and near electoral disaster. Of course, problems\\nwere never going to disappear from a simple change of year--this much\\nI knew. But things eerily escalated right in the very first week, all\\nwithin and without. Week 1 of 2021 didn't just seem to be a\\ncontinuation of 2020, week 1 felt like 2020 itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>The ultimate upside is that, just like 2020, I endured much pain, but\\ncame out stronger and more understanding in the end.</p>\\n\\n<p>Like 2020, I took stock of many things around me, and inside of me.\\nDespite all the work and progress done in 2020, I realized I stlll had\\nmore to do. Certain old patterns no longer served me, and despite how\\nmuch stronger I thought I was, I was still too admittedly co-dependent and\\nappeasing to admit it--and accordingly, I still wasn't respecting myself enough.</p>\\n\\n<p>I've been hurt before, even physically, in ways that exacerbate my own\\nproblems, or even made me feel like I deserved what happened to me.</p>\\n\\n<p>I've also emotionally hurt others, too, even if unintentionally.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is so much pain in the world now than in any other time in my\\nlife, and it's so sad. I miss so many people/places/things, and I have so many\\nregrets. There are several people I wish things could've been\\ndifferent with, but can now no longer talk to.</p>\\n\\n<p>I can't change the past, but I thank them for all the growth they have\\nhelped me achieve, and I hope we can all find the peace and happiness we deserve in\\nthis crazy world.</p>\\n\\n<p>Last year was about not giving up on myself; the beginning of this\\nyear seems to be about giving up bad or non-serving things. Among\\nother things, I haven't drank since the new year, either (yup, that's\\na long time for me). And I'm continuing to update this site with my\\nown feelings/writings, and about to start a project with a friend. I'm\\nactively learning languages again every day, hopeful to travel for our\\ncollective non-COVID future.  Despite the pain of week 1, like 2020 I survived, and here I am. I am\\nall right.</p>\\n\\n<p>And I know you will be, too.</p>\\n\";","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
