<h1>Pizza and Perspective</h1>
<h4>2/21/21 7:13PM</h4>

<p>There is a brick-oven pizza spot that is about a ten-minute walk
from my house. I had built up an appetite after an afternoon of
coding, so I decided to pre-order on the phone from them. Especially now in the era of COVID,
if I can pre-order food to minimize my time inside, then I'll happily
do so, and I'm a regular there who always orders the same thing.</p>

<p>So I was quite surprised and irritated when I gave my order but was
told rather curtly and rudely to "just order when you come", because
my order was insufficient, and they ended the call quickly.</p>

<p>I decided to go there anyway, but my mood was a bit soured. Once I
got there, I discovered that they were backed up with about an hour's
worth of uncollected pickup orders, and were still taking more. My order was thankfully among
them, so I didn't have to order and wait, but I finally understood why
they were so rude and snippy earlier.</p>

<p>I felt better about people for awhile, until I passed by a person
idling in their car who locked their doors as I walked by.</p>


<p>Yeah, gun, mask, and pizza, all the essentials to commit grand theft
auto. That is some purse-clutching wuss behavior right there.</p>
