<h1>Pizza and Perspective</h1>
<h4>2/21/21 7:13PM</h4>

<p>There is a brick-oven pizza spot that is about a ten-minute walk
from my house. I had built up an appetite after an afternoon of
coding, so I decided to pre-order on the phone from them. Especially now in the era of COVID,
if I can pre-order food to minimize my time inside, then I'll happily
do so, and I'm a regular there who always orders the same thing.</p>

<p>So I was quite surprised and irritated when I gave my order but was
told rather curtly and rudely to "just order when you come", because
my order was insufficient, and they ended the call quickly.</p>



Yeah, gun, mask, and pizza, all the essentials to commit grand theft
auto. That is some purse-clutching wuss behavior right there.
