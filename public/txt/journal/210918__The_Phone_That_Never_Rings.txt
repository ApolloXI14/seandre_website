<h1>The Phone That Never Rings</h1>

<p>Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of my favorite animes ever, which I have a complicated relationship with.</p>
<p>It had a particular episode, "The Phone That Never Rings".</p>
<p>I found that to be a poetic and poignant concept when younger--a mobile phone that never rings, much lonely, so isolation--but like many things in my jaded early-thirysomethings, I see it less favorably, and think they got it wrong.</p>
<p>They did not account for spam.</p>
<p>Even the world's loneliest, most miserable bastard will still get spam.</p>
<p>Because I know I do.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen exclusively by a phone call, although that does happen plenty, from all sorts of area codes and sometimes
international numbers.</p>
<p>The latest and most insidious way it happens is via text, through
I never win anything) or thanks me for paying a bill (I know bills suck, but I don't pay bills...daily?), and asks me to click on a link.</p>
<p>I was upset enough recently by the frequency of this spam to search and find an official FTC number to
forward text spam to, 7726.</p>
<p>Like my faith in voting and my purpose on this dying rock, I don't
know if it means anything or makes a difference, but I sure hope it does.</p>
<p>Because trying something is better than doing (and ultimately being) nothing, right?</p>
