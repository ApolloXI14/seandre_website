    {title: "Phrases That Annoy Me", date: 210213, content: "<h1>5 Phrases That Annoy Me</h1><h4>2/13/21 9:46AM</h4><p>Language is beautiful, and I love words. The right series of words strung together can be as gorgeous to me as all the art in the Louvre. But language is always changing, and it doesn't always change to my liking; sometimes I find it redundant or nonsensical, or just poor in grammar. And I have an old lit degree and a keyboard, and you're here for some reason, so I demand you listen to me. Here are some phrases I dislike.</p><ol><li><cite>\"Make it make sense\"</cite> - Saying \"make\" twice makes no sense. Just say... \"Make sense\". (Make sense?)</li><li><cite>\"Yes and no\"</cite> - This is a meaningless non-statement, the verbal equivalent of dividing by zero, a paradox. If a waiter asked me if I wanted water, and I said \"Yes and no\", I'd be looked at very funny. I've heard this phrase be defended as an alternate way to to say \"It's complicated\", and my reply is... <i>just say that!</i> \"Yes and no\" or its alternate \"It is and it isn't\" is just hoity-toity nothingness. Just say what you mean.</li><li><cite>\"First and last\"</cite> - \"Last\" is an antonym of \"first\", because \"last\" means the end of a series or set, so something cannot simultaneously be the first  <i>and</i> last of something. You'll never hear a train conductor say \"This is the first <i>and</i> last stop of this train!\" What people really mean when they say this is \"first and <i>only</i>\"</li><li><cite>\"Could care less\"</cite> - How much less?</li><li><cite>\"Sorry, I'm an [insert astrological sign here]\"</cite> - Not really a violation of grammar so much as a violation of common sense and decency. Blaming disproven astrological beliefs and the stars and Mars for all of your mistakes is the height of being basic to me. I get it, I used to be into astrology, too...but then I got out of my early 20s.</li></ol><p>I felt like there were more that are escaping my mind right now, but I'll just conclude it right here. Speak responsibly, everyone.</p>"},
    {title: "Pizza and Perspective", date: 210221, content: "<h1>Pizza and Perspective</h1><h4>2/21/21 7:13PM</h4><p>There is a brick-oven pizza spot that is about a ten-minute walk from my house. I had built up an appetite after an afternoon of coding, so I decided to pre-order on the phone from them. Especially now in the era of COVID,if I can pre-order food to minimize my time inside, then I'll happily do so, and I'm a regular there who always orders the same thing.</p><p>So I was quite surprised and irritated when I gave my order but wastold rather curtly and rudely to \"just order when you come\", because my order was insufficient, and they ended the call quickly.</p><p>I decided to go there anyway, but my mood was a bit soured. Once I got there, I discovered that they were backed up with about an hour'sworth of uncollected pickup orders, and were still taking more. My order was thankfully among them, so I didn't have to order and wait, but I finally understood whythey were so rude and snippy earlier.</p><p>I felt better about people for awhile, until I passed by a personidling in their car who locked their doors as I walked by.</p><p>Yeah, gun, mask, and pizza, all the essentials to commit grand theft auto. That is some purse-clutching wuss behavior right there.</p>"},
    {title: "Seandre 2.0", date: 210808, content: "<h1>Seandre 2.0</h1><h4>8/8/21 7:49PM</h4><p>Hey you. It's been almost six months since we've last spoken. No, I didn't die. An old version of me did, though. So if you're still here after all this time, or here for the first time: thank you.</p><p>I had to rebuild a lot of this website before I could continue with updates. During the process, I also had to rebuild a lot of myself, too. I've been through a lot in the past half year, some of which I might decide to write about later.</p><p>The things I've been through have thrown me off of my focus a lot, taking time away from my personal projects, and then, when I had the time, leaving me with little to no energy left.</p><p>Nonetheless, starting in June, I pushed through with rebuilding this website, much like I push through work. The rebuilding required much research and trial and error, and I felt old insecurities and frustration mounting, wondering what am I really doing. But I remembered that I had already proven myself by launching the site in the first place, so I can do it again now. And eventually I did.</p><p>But then I felt the biggest fear of all, much more than coding: writing.</p><p>How could I have coded so much, have rebuilt so much, but then, at the end, be afraid to write anything?</p><p>Because coding is just coding, but writing is me.</p><p>Life itself is a never-ending project of self-discovery and improvement, and so is just about anything else in it (relationships, work projects, or random personal websites). The key isn't to be perfect, because nothing is or ever will be. The key is to just do it, and try to be better today than you were the day before. Just like me and this post.</p>"},
   {title: "The Phone That Never Sleeps", date: 210918, content: "</p><p>I found that to be a poetic and poignant concept when younger--a mobile phone that never rings, much lonely, so isolation--but like many things in my jaded early-thirysomethings, I see it</p><p>The latest and most insidious way it happens is via text, throughI never win anything) or thanks me for paying a bill (I know bills suck, but I don't pay bills...daily?), and asks me to c</p>"},
   {title: "Free Will", date: 220402, content: "<h1>Free Will</h1><h4>4/2/22</h4><img src=\"/../../img/malcom_x_wrong.jpg\"/><p>I want to talk about free will, accountability, and this Malcolm X quote and what it means to me, especially in light of \"The Slap\".</p><p>I posted this quote originally on my personal Facebook years ago; I think it was the summer of 2020, shortly after the Floyd protests, in response to a news report of a 4th of July shooting in the Bronx where a child was hit with a stray bullet and sent to the hospital. The child wasn't hit in a vital organ or vein, so they thankfully survived, but it still made me furious and I called it out as needless and unnecessary.</p><p>Someone commented critically, saying that this Malcolm X quote was in reference to blind American patriotism, not black people, and thereal issue is \"systemic racism\", and highlighting black violence givescover to racists.</p><p>I strongly disagreed with that comment, just like I strongly disagree with \"The Slap\" last weekend and think Will should be held financially/legally accountable for it like anybody else would. Hereis why.</p><p>There is more than one kind of blind patriotism. And what I sadly see in too many of the \"slap\" defenses from black people this past week is essentially \"blind black patriotism\". This kind of blind black patriotism essentially means protecting all black people at all costs, no matter what they do...even if it's to other black people, in our owncommunities. This is the same kind of blind black patriotism that hascreated the \"no snitching\" culture of the streets.</p><p>Looking at history, I empathize with why many people think thisway.  Systemic racism is real, especially in policing. We would rather tolerate violence and crime by ourselves, to ourselves, than to throw a black person at a historically racist and brutal institution likethe criminal justice system, to see them become a statistic, and givemore fodder to racists.</p><p>But as much as I empathize with this position, I find it fundamentally toxic and wrong...misguided loyalty and enablement toward abusers and the worst elements in our own community, out of a communal sense of \"us vs. them\" Stockholm Syndrome.</p><p>I have read a nauseating amount of puff pieces in the media sympathizing with Will/Jada's side; about Will's trauma as a child watching his father abuse his mother and not do anything about it; about the jokes he gets for his marriage...a marriage he himself chooses to stay in and make 100% transparent to the entire world forscrutiny and commentary. But I have seen little mainstream media sympathy about one black man assaulting another for freedom of speech,and how it must feel for that assaulted black man to be humiliated infront of the whole world, to be memed about forever, to have armchair tough guys criticize him for not doing anything back, when he did thevery best he could...and I have seen so much \"He had it coming / Hebeen joking 'bout her for years / He shoulda known better\" toxicfemininity happily clapping for the slap. As someone who has survivedabuse himself, I have found this lack of consideration sickening and triggering...and also hypocritical from the same people who would all say \"Black Lives Matter\".</p><p>Yet I still worked the longest week I have in a very long time,sleeping only a few hours a night, and I didn't slap a single person over it. And I don't have millions of dollars to comfort me (yet,anyway).</p><p>We all carry trauma and pain inside of us, and we could all use more empathy for each other. Millions of black people carry trauma with them to work every day, generational trauma even; but we do NOT assault one another for it. Our trauma is our cross to bear, and our salone. Talk about it with your friends/family, seek therapy if you must, but do not take it out on others. Once you do that, you are crossing a line, and must be held accountable.</p><p>Chris Rock was a victim of severe childhood bullying, and it got so bad he sent a bully to the hospital for months over it, and had to gettherapy for anger issues.</p><p>R. Kelly was also a victim as a child. He was molested. This should never happen to any child, and I wish we lived in a world where it happened to nobody, ever. My heart breaks just thinking about thechild Robert Kelly, with nobody to protect him.</p><p>But once he grew up into an adult with his own free will and the ability to choose better and/or seek help, he did neither and became a serial child predator, and he needed to be stopped and held accountable.</p><p>Too many black people did not have the heart to hold him accountable, because of blind black patriotism, and also because ofhis celebrity.  And I understand why. I did it, too. Everyone remembers and loves \"I Believe I Can Fly\", \"Happy People\", and\"Ignition\", just to name a few hits. I too participated in this culture of mentally blocking or shrugging off his obvious, visible abuse (cue the legendary Chappelle Show \"Piss On You\" joke) because his music was great, and he was a wealthy famous black man living the\"American Dream\", and the idea of holding him accountable and putting him at the mercy of an already racist and flawed justice system was too much to bear.</p><p>But while we all decided to look away, what was he doing?</p><p>Victimizing more black girls.</p><p>It's always easy to do the wrong thing, which is often doing nothing at all, a.k.a. \"don't snitch\". Doing the right thing is always hard, but it doesn't make it any less necessary. Otherwise, the costof doing nothing is choosing to continue to victimize ourselves...and like the \"Ouroboros\" snake eating its own tail, the cycle will be endless. That slap wasn't just to a comedian on stage, it was to all of us as a people, and we need to stop slapping ourselves, ignoring it, and calling it \"love\". That is essentially mass-scale self-abuse.</p><figure><img src=\"/../../img/Ouroboros.jpg\"/ title=\"Ouroboros\" alt=\"Ouroboros snake eating its own tail\"/>  <figcaption>Ouroboros snake eating its own tail</figcaption></figure><p>Many will strawman this as \"respectability\" or \"seeking white acceptance\" or whatever, and call me a \"Tom\" or a traitor. That is flat-out wrong to me, and though it might offend me, I won't slap those people for it, and I've been called worse. I want black people to be better to ourselves, FOR ourselves, not for anybody else.I love black people, but true love also involves honest criticism and accountability, just like criticizing America doesn't mean you hate it. To borrow the song of another famous black man with a troubledpast, we need to start with the \"Man in the Mirror\" to make a change.Yes, systemic racism is real, historical disadvantages are real, andthey must be called out and eliminated, so we have less \"ghettos\" and\"hoods\" and have better schools & neighborhoods and more homeownership & business ownership to build generational wealth andgive our present and future people a better chance--but none of that eliminates our own agency as individuals, right here and right now, asyou're reading this. We have the free will (ha) to make better choices, whenever and wherever possible. Physical slavery ended in1865, but as Bob Marley said, we must emancipate ourselves from mentalslavery. We can only do that by freeing ourselves from a racist tribal\"us vs. them\" mentality, and hold ourselves accountable to do better,and also hold accountable those who don't.</p><p>Otherwise, we as black people are no better than white supremacy and white tribalism, and you cannot get mad that people like theTrumps get away with literally everything, either. And we will allslowly be on the road to hell as a society.</p><p>Beyond just black people, I think we as a society need to be lesstribal, and free ourselves from tribal, binary, absolutist thinking.The tribalism and zero-sum, binary mentality that thislate-stage-capitalist Darwinist shithole we call \"America\" has put upon too many people is saddening to me and makes me fear for the future now more than ever. We can call out systemic racism while also preaching for accountability for ourselves; we can \"protect black women\" (peacefully and in true self-defense only), while still callingout male abuse, and not endorse toxic masculinity to \"Take it like a man\" or get violent over words. None of these things are mutually exclusive, and arguing for one does not diminish or distract from the other. On the contrary, willfully ignoring one exclusively for the other just makes for rank hypocrisy, and like Ouroboros again, the cycle of conflict will continue.</p><p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading. If you disagree,please don't slap me.</p>"},

  {title: "The Future Refuses to Change", date: 220524, content: "<h1>The Future Refused to Change</h1><h4>5/24/22 9:55PM</h4><img src=\"/../../img/the_future_refused_to_change.jpg\"/><p>The image of this journal entry is the most haunting game over screen I've ever seen, from one of the greatest video games of all time, in my humble opinion.</p><p>The game's name is \"Chrono Trigger\", a role-playing game released in1995 on the Super Nintendo. It takes place on an earth-like planet and begins in the year 1000AD, which is the equivalent of our real-life medieval times, with some fantasy elements. Imagine dragons (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Dragons\">hyuk</a>), knights, castles, princesses, magic.</p><p>Time travel is a major theme in the game. The silent protagonist, Crono, discovers that a massive alien parasite from outer space named Lavos impacted the planet and embedded itself deep inside millions of years ago, in the \"prehistoric\" times of 65 million BC. Lavos remains dormant for eons like a supermassive volcano, unbeknownst to all of humanity, but Crono discovers that Lavos becomes active in the year 2000AD, which is a modern and urban time like our current civilization, and destroys the world, bringing about an apocalypse and triggering a futuristic dystopia, which can be seen in the year2300AD.</p><p>The main conflict in the game is for Crono is his band of friends--from the past, present, and future--to defeat Lavos and prevent this.</p><p>But if you as the player fail to do so, you get this image.</p><p>I remember staring solemnly at this screen the first time my much younger and more idealistic self saw this. It's one of those things you just \"need a moment\" for, to absorb and process. It wasn't like any other \"Game Over\" screen I had seen, where I knew that I was just playing a game, just for fun, and nothing really mattered. It really felt like I had personally failed to avert a foreseeable disaster, and I watched our \"pale blue dot\" as Carl Sagan called it, the only home we've all ever known, be destroyed.</p><figure><img src=\"../../img/me_after_chrono_trigger_game_over.jpg\" alt=\"Me after Chrono Trigger Game Over\" /> <figcaption>Real, unedited photos of myself after the Chrono Trigger Game Over</figcaption></figure><p>This image has stuck with me as I've gotten older, and the more terrible events that I see in the world--especially recurring, predictable, preventable events--the more I think this image is us.</p><p>Shootings have become normalized, and politicians don't care. Humans (read: corporations)are destroying the climate, and governments aren't doing enough about it. Fascism is resurging and the left so far has been too weak to effectively fight it. We are living in a new Gilded Age, worse than even the \"Roaring Twenties\", where the rich keep getting richer while wages have been stagnant for decades and homelessness rises, but our \"representatives\" keep colluding with these rich corporate donors instead of truly representing the people. Income inequality is worse than ever. The pandemic pulled the curtain back on our \"society\", erasing the veneer over how inhumane our \"human civilization\" really is, while accelerating all these terrible trends that were already underway. It feels like we as a species are getting closer everyday to realizing all of our sci-fi dystopian fictions--the Matrix, Blade Runner, Terminator,Elysium, whatever, take your pick. \"1984\" feels cliche to mention, but sure, why not that, too? MLK's last speech before he was assassinated was called \"Why America May Go to Hell\", and like an old AC/DC song, I feel like we're speeding down that highway.</p><p>I've kinda-but-not-really joked about this during the pandemic: Agent Smith in the first Matrix was right when he said humans are a virus.The real pandemic is us. Not even racism and hate crimes stopped during quarantine, but pollution sure did, as satellite images showed. What does that show us?</p><p>I try to resist misanthrophy and nihilism, but it sure is hard sometimes, when I see how crappy the world is and how it refuses to change, no matter how hard people protest for it and demand it. I've participated in protests. I've called my representatives over issues Ifelt mattered. I've donated and raised money for causes I cared about.And yet, like Tupac Shakur said, I see no changes.</p><p>Nonetheless, I don't really think humans are villains; I think human greed and apathy are the real villains. Humanity has great capacity for both evil and good, as history shows. I try to remember and tell myself this, no matter how foolish it feels when I see news of the one trillionth shooting or hate crime, or more evidence of the climate changing for the worse.</p><p>I don't have any solutions to these problems that I mentioned. I don't have a feelgood ending planned for this post. I'm just doing what I've done since I was a child: write. If I can't make something right, I write something, in some feeble hope it can change the future, like writings of the past have changed me. I know change doesn't come overnight; change requires consistency and self-sacrifice. At the opposite end of every push for change is a villain that refuses change, that wants things to stay the same, if not worse. This is how people succumb to their demons or addictions--or how planets die.</p><p>I guess the only positive thing I can say is: don't ever change your desire for change. Don't give up, no matter how silly it feels, no matter how small the resistance is.</p><p>We are all time travelers, like Crono. We're traveling forward in time every second of every day, living on a giant spinning rock circling a ball of hot plasma.</p><p>And we can always change the future...unless we refuse to.</p><p>P.S. Play Chrono Trigger, loser.</p>"},
